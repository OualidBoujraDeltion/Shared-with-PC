Syrianna.

After a rough night she awakens due to someone/-thing hitting her.
The moment she crawls up, she immediately searches arround, "Where is she.." Syrianna said.
She realizes that she's all alone from now on.
As she still remembers the road she was traveling.. she continues it.
On the side of the path she finds a map, the only thing she recognizes is the cityname (Mom) was talking about.
"(City-Name) is where I'm heading for." Syrianna said out loud.

-- Platform levels --

As she continued her path towards (City-Name), she hears someone whispering her name..
She recognized the voice immediately and starts to look around for her.
In the distant she sees someone lying down on the ground begging for something water.

"It's (Mom)!"..
She starts to run as fast as possible to her and helps her get up.
Syrianna starts to cry as she sees that (Mom) has no energy left to stand on her own (legs/feet).
"Water.. wa-water.." is all she was asking for.

.. The refugee-camp isn't much further.
Syrianna starts to run towards it.
As she approaches the entrance, the guard asks for her name.

The guard lets her in and she starts searching for water.
She sees people waiting in line to get themselfs food and a bottle of water.
She gets in line and waits.. and waits..
It's her turn now.
She grabs the bottle and drops the food, everyone notices it and look at her.
She starts running back to the entrance with one thing in mind.

As she approaches the gate, the guard stops her and explains her that she cant leave the camp.
Syrianna tries to explain her situation but the guard couldn't make any exception.
The guard warned her that if she leaves there is no way back in.

============================================================================================================
Decision
============================================================================================================

Option 1.
She listens to the guard and follows his advice.
She decides to stay at the camp and realizes she has nothing left beside an useless map, a bottle of water and a cheap bed..
Syrianna gets to her bed and lays down..

Option 2.
She denies to follow the guards advice and decides to leave the camp.
Thirsty, tired and exhausted she keeps running the path back towards her mom..
"There she is!" she happily said.
The closer she gets the more worried she gets, "..M-mom?"

"Mom?.."
